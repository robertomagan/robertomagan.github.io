	abstract = {Communication networks and systems are continuously threatened by a great variety of cybersecurity attacks coming from new malware that targets old and new systems’ vulnerabilities. In this sense, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) and, specifically, Network IDSs (NIDSs) are used to count on robust methods and techniques to detect and classify security attacks. One of the important parts in the assessment of NIDSs, is the Feature Engineering (FE) process, where raw datasets are transformed onto derived ones where both, features and observations are smartly transformed. In this work, the ff4ml framework, which includes the Feature as a Counter (FaaC) FE approach, is used to transform raw features into new ones that are counters of the originals. The FaaC approach aggregates raw observations by time intervals, thus limiting its use to network datasets containing timestamps. This work proposes a batch-based aggregation technique that allows applying FaaC in timestamp-less datasets and analyzes its impact on the performance of Machine Learning (ML)-based NIDSs in comparison to timestamp-based aggregation approaches.},

They have a decentralized management, are flexible and versatile but their characteristics are in turn their main weaknesses. This work introduces a preliminary analysis of the evolution, trends and the state of the art in the context of the security in ad hoc networks. To this end, two different methodologies are applied: a bibliometric analysis and a Systematic Literature Review. Results show that security in MANETs and VANETs are still an appealing research field. In addition, we realized that there is no clear separation of solutions by line of defense. This is because they are sometimes misclassified by the authors or simply there is no line of defense that totally fit well with the proposed solution. Because of that, new taxonomies including novel definitions of lines of defense are needed. In this work, we propose the use of tolerant or survivable solutions which are the ones that preserve critical system or network services in presence of fault, malfunctions or attacks.},

One of the most usual architecture for IoT ecosystems has three layers (Acquisition, Networks and Applications), and provides the security to the different elements of the IoT ecosystems through specific technology or techniques, available in the different layers. However, the deployment of security technology at each layer complicates the management and maintainability of the security credentials increasing the risk of information leak, greater manual intervention and complicates the maintainability of consistency of the sensitive data. In this paper we propose a new architecture model, where a fourth security layer has been added, containing all the security technology traditionally delegated to the other layers, removing them from other layers. This new model is supported by the widespread use of Digital Objects, covering all aspects including physical components, processes and sensed data.},

The optimal locations of the agents are computed from the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, which maximizes the global network connectivity and thus mitigates the negative effects produced by malicious nodes on the network performance.

The mechanism is started after detecting the existence of nodes with malicious behavior, and is based on the use of one or more mobile agents to improve the connectivity of the network. This way, in the event of the detection of a malicious node (e.g. a selfish node or a dropper node), an agent is employed to maximize the overall connectivity of the network. Every agent acts as a relaying node within the MANET and it is automatically positioned according to a particle swarm optimization (PSO) process. This paper represents a work in progress. However, the promising results obtained show the good suitability of the approach to improve the survivability of the network from a security perspective.},

One of them is MARS, a self-healing system intended to mitigate the malicious effects of common threats in MANETs. MARS makes use of special agent nodes to recover the loss of connectivity due to the operation of malicious nodes in the environment. Despite the general good performance of MARS, this paper shows some situations in which it does not work properly. This is caused by an inappropriate behavior of the optimization objective function considered in MARS. To overcome this limitation, a couple of alternative functions are designed and evaluated. The effectiveness of the new proposals is validated through extensive experiments. The new optimization functions lead to an increase in the resilience and tolerance of the network against security threats, improving network survivability.},

They rely on the use of predefined dataset’s for their training and evaluation. However, datasets inner characteristics directly affect the robustness, reliability and performance of NIDSs. In this work, we propose the use of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to accurately generate network topologies. For that, we consider the IP addresses as a categorical information to generate them.

Together with Italy, Spain is one of the countries with more agriculture impact in the European Union. After years of crisis, one of the basis to reactivate the agriculture is the optimization of cultivation techniques, which implies a deep digital transformation. For this reason, the IoT (Internet of Things) adoption for crop monitoring involves a huge evolution for those who are implementing it. EGIDA is the first Cervera Excelence Network for security and privacy protection. One of the goals of this collaboration network is to make people aware about the need of adopting a secure digital transformation. There is a high effort to perform an active securization of IoT environments, especially in agrifood. In this context, and after the collaboration between the University of Granada (UGR) and Fidesol, a prototype for anomaly detection in IoT networks for the agriculture sector, has been developed. For the first time, the MSNM-sensor (MSNM-S) is deployed and tested in an IoT scenario. In this paper, we present the results of the first tests, that consist in launching different attacks of two types: DoS (Denial of Service) and Data Exfiltration. These attacks have been selected due to their importance and presence in the use case under study.},
