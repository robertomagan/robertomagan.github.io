abstract: Few proposals exist in the literature where security in networks and communications
  is studied from a pro-active perspective. One of them is MARS, a self-healing system
  intended to mitigate the malicious effects of common threats in MANETs. MARS makes
  use of special agent nodes to recover the loss of connectivity due to the operation
  of malicious nodes in the environment. Despite the general good performance of MARS,
  this paper shows some situations in which it does not work properly. This is caused
  by an inappropriate behavior of the optimization objective function considered in
  MARS. To overcome this limitation, a couple of alternative functions are designed
  and evaluated. The effectiveness of the new proposals is validated through extensive
  experiments. The new optimization functions lead to an increase in the resilience
  and tolerance of the network against security threats, improving network survivability.
