abstract: MANETs are specially vulnerable against security attacks. For protecting
  them, security solutions are traditionally addressed by the so-called intrusion
  detection and response systems. Nevertheless, using reactive (response) solutions,
  once the attack is detected, rely in long attack mitigation times. In this work,
  we propose the use of relay node placement techniques as proactive security solutions.
  Preliminary experimentation demonstrates the suitability and feasibility of such
  approaches, not only in reducing the attack mitigation time but in replacing detection
  and response based traditional solutions.
