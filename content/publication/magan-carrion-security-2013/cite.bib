 abstract = {The existence of malicious nodes in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) can degrade (and even interrupt) the overall operation of the network. To avoid this we propose a novelty multi-agent response/tolerance scheme based on the dynamic deployment of distributed agents to sustain the quality of the service in the presence of malicious nodes. The optimal locations of the agents are computed from the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, which maximizes the global network connectivity and thus mitigates the negative effects produced by malicious nodes on the network performance. Since this paper tries to provide a practical vision of the system developed, we focus here on the associated functional architecture and its operation in a simulated scenario.},
