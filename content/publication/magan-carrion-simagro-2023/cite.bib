 abstract = {Primary sector is one of the most important sectors in Andalusia, being one of the most relevant areas within this sector the agriculture. Together with Italy, Spain is one of the countries with more agriculture impact in the European Union. After years of crisis, one of the basis to reactivate the agriculture is the optimization of cultivation techniques, which implies a deep digital transformation. For this reason, the IoT (Internet of Things) adoption for crop monitoring involves a huge evolution for those who are implementing it. EGIDA is the first Cervera Excelence Network for security and privacy protection. One of the goals of this collaboration network is to make people aware about the need of adopting a secure digital transformation. There is a high effort to perform an active securization of IoT environments, especially in agrifood. In this context, and after the collaboration between the University of Granada (UGR) and Fidesol, a prototype for anomaly detection in IoT networks for the agriculture sector, has been developed. For the first time, the MSNM-sensor (MSNM-S) is deployed and tested in an IoT scenario. In this paper, we present the results of the first tests, that consist in launching different attacks of two types: DoS (Denial of Service) and Data Exfiltration. These attacks have been selected due to their importance and presence in the use case under study.},
