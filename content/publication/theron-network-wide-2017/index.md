abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new visualization tool for network-wide intrusion
  detection. It is based in multivariate anomaly detection with a combination between
  Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a new variant called Group-wise PCA (GPCA).
  Combining these methodologies with the capabilities of interactive visualization,
  the resulting tool is a highly flexible and intuitive interface that allows the
  user to navigate through the enormous amount of data collected in the network, in
  order to find anomalous or unexpected behaviors. We use a real case study to illustrate
  the capability of the tool to unveil the complex mixture of information that can
  be found in network security/traffic data and identify and diagnose anomalies in
  it.
