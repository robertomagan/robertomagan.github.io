 abstract = {This paper introduces a response mechanism to improve the tolerance against security threats in MANET environments. The mechanism is started after detecting the existence of nodes with malicious behavior, and is based on the use of one or more mobile agents to improve the connectivity of the network. This way, in the event of the detection of a malicious node (e.g. a selfish node or a dropper node), an agent is employed to maximize the overall connectivity of the network. Every agent acts as a relaying node within the MANET and it is automatically positioned according to a particle swarm optimization (PSO) process. This paper represents a work in progress. However, the promising results obtained show the good suitability of the approach to improve the survivability of the network from a security perspective.},
