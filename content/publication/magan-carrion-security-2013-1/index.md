abstract: This paper introduces a response mechanism to improve the tolerance against
  security threats in MANET environments. The mechanism is started after detecting
  the existence of nodes with malicious behavior, and is based on the use of one or
  more mobile agents to improve the connectivity of the network. This way, in the
  event of the detection of a malicious node (e.g. a selfish node or a dropper node),
  an agent is employed to maximize the overall connectivity of the network. Every
  agent acts as a relaying node within the MANET and it is automatically positioned
  according to a particle swarm optimization (PSO) process. This paper represents
  a work in progress. However, the promising results obtained show the good suitability
  of the approach to improve the survivability of the network from a security perspective.
