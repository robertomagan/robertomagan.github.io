 abstract = {Communication networks and systems are continuously threatened by a great variety of cybersecurity attacks coming from new malware that targets old and new systems’ vulnerabilities. In this sense, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) and, specifically, Network IDSs (NIDSs) are used to count on robust methods and techniques to detect and classify security attacks. One of the important parts in the assessment of NIDSs, is the Feature Engineering (FE) process, where raw datasets are transformed onto derived ones where both, features and observations are smartly transformed. In this work, the ff4ml framework, which includes the Feature as a Counter (FaaC) FE approach, is used to transform raw features into new ones that are counters of the originals. The FaaC approach aggregates raw observations by time intervals, thus limiting its use to network datasets containing timestamps. This work proposes a batch-based aggregation technique that allows applying FaaC in timestamp-less datasets and analyzes its impact on the performance of Machine Learning (ML)-based NIDSs in comparison to timestamp-based aggregation approaches.},
