abstract: Communication networks and systems are continuously threatened by a great
  variety of cybersecurity attacks coming from new malware that targets old and new
  systems’ vulnerabilities. In this sense, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) and,
  specifically, Network IDSs (NIDSs) are used to count on robust methods and techniques
  to detect and classify security attacks. One of the important parts in the assessment
  of NIDSs, is the Feature Engineering (FE) process, where raw datasets are transformed
  onto derived ones where both, features and observations are smartly transformed.
  In this work, the ff4ml framework, which includes the Feature as a Counter (FaaC)
  FE approach, is used to transform raw features into new ones that are counters of
  the originals. The FaaC approach aggregates raw observations by time intervals,
  thus limiting its use to network datasets containing timestamps. This work proposes
  a batch-based aggregation technique that allows applying FaaC in timestamp-less
  datasets and analyzes its impact on the performance of Machine Learning (ML)-based
  NIDSs in comparison to timestamp-based aggregation approaches.
