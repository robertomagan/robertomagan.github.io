abstract: Security is one of the most challenging issues facing the Internet of Things.
  One of the most usual architecture for IoT ecosystems has three layers (Acquisition,
  Networks and Applications), and provides the security to the different elements
  of the IoT ecosystems through specific technology or techniques, available in the
  different layers. However, the deployment of security technology at each layer complicates
  the management and maintainability of the security credentials increasing the risk
  of information leak, greater manual intervention and complicates the maintainability
  of consistency of the sensitive data. In this paper we propose a new architecture
  model, where a fourth security layer has been added, containing all the security
  technology traditionally delegated to the other layers, removing them from other
  layers. This new model is supported by the widespread use of Digital Objects, covering
  all aspects including physical components, processes and sensed data.
