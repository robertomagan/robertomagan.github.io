 abstract = {Security is one of the most challenging issues facing the Internet of Things. One of the most usual architecture for IoT ecosystems has three layers (Acquisition, Networks and Applications), and provides the security to the different elements of the IoT ecosystems through specific technology or techniques, available in the different layers. However, the deployment of security technology at each layer complicates the management and maintainability of the security credentials increasing the risk of information leak, greater manual intervention and complicates the maintainability of consistency of the sensitive data. In this paper we propose a new architecture model, where a fourth security layer has been added, containing all the security technology traditionally delegated to the other layers, removing them from other layers. This new model is supported by the widespread use of Digital Objects, covering all aspects including physical components, processes and sensed data.},
