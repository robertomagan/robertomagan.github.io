abstract: This work introduces NETA, a novel framework for the simulation of communication
  networks attacks. It is built on top of the INET framework and the OMNET++ simulator,
  using the generally accepted implementations of many different protocols, as well
  as models for mobility, battery consumption, channel errors, etc. NETA is intended
  to become an useful framework for researchers focused on the network security field.
  Its flexible design is appropriate for the implementation and evaluation of many
  types of attacks, doing it accurate for the benchmarking of current defense solutions
  under same testing conditions or for the development of new defense techniques.
  As a proof of concept, three different attacks have been implemented in NETA. The
  capabilities of NETA are exhibited by evaluating the performance of the three implemented
  attacks under different MANET deployments.
