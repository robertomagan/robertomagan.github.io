abstract: Relay node (RN) placement is a challenging problem, specially in mobile
  ad hoc networks (MANETs) environments where the locations of the nodes are continuously
  changing. In this context we propose here a novel, modular and adaptable RN placement
  solution based on the joint maximization of the network connectivity and throughput.
  For that, we use a combination of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and model predictive
  control (MPC) inspired methodologies to drive the RN movements. In order to corroborate
  the validity and applicability of the approach we implement, deploy and test the
  proposed solution in a real MANET environment where the nodes are mobile robots.
